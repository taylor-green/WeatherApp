# WeatherApp

## Description
This is a web based weather app that was created using JavaScript code and a weather API. It allows a user to search for a city and see the current weather and a 5 day forecast. It uses local storage to save the users recent searches. 

It sets constants for an API key and the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API. It selects DOM elements using querySelector and sets variables for the city and search history. It loads the search history from localStorage if it exists, using JSON.parse to convert the stored string to an array of strings. It then renders the search history to the page using a function.

## Code and Tech
I utilized VS Code to build this project. Other technologies used were JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the OpenWeatherMap API. All of these elements work together to create a functioning web application that allows the user to check the weather in the city that they search.

## Features
This application features a search bar when the user first visits the page.
